Boilerplate for Single Page Layout With Sticky Navigaiton/Menu

Inspired from single page websites/layouts, this boiler plate will easily enable UI developers to make use
of a neat sticky(fixed) navigation/menu. 

A user can click on menu's that will scroll smoothly to a point of interest.

Features to add:
================
1) Dynamically add more menu's or topics while scrolling through the bottom of page
2) Planned to implement AJAX loading
3) Implment Responsive UI
4) Create parallax effect for scrolling.

The primitive version is bit crude. It needs to be re-written greatly to make it more optimized and consice.

Thanks!
